		</section>

	<section>
		<p>The project I am proposing is an interactive digital archive of the QR code stickers in Wellington city. Many groups/individuals scatter QR codes around the city which connects the physical 3D space to the network of the internet. <br>However, these QR codes are not permanent. Many of them are on posters which are changed frequently, or sticker grafitti which is removed by the council or the weather. I am proposing a website with a digital map of the city (like google maps) which you can explore and find QR codes that are/were once in the city. They will be on the map where they were found in the city. </p>

		<p>The target audience of this website are most likely people living in Wellington city, as they will be the most interestd in what websites the codes lead to. More specifically, it will be those who wander around the city and actually encounter these codes on a day to day baisis (students, people who walk to work), and people who browse
 the internet	a lot who will be the most interested in this site.
			However, tourists and pepole from around New Zealand may also be interested in exploring the QR codes of Wellington. </p>
