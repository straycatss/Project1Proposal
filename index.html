		<p>The project I am proposing is an interactive digital archive of the QR code stickers in Wellington city. Many groups/individuals scatter QR codes around the city which connects the physical 3D space to the network of the internet. <br>However, these QR codes are not permanent. Many of them are on posters which are changed frequently, or sticker grafitti which is removed by the council or the weather. I am proposing a website with a digital map of the city (like google maps) which you can explore and find QR codes that are/were once in the city. They will be on the map where they were found in the city. </p>
