		<h2> Project overview </h2>
		<p>The project I am proposing is an interactive digital archive of the QR code stickers in Wellington city. Many groups/individuals scatter QR codes around the city which connects the physical 3D space to the network of the internet. <br> <br>
			However, these QR codes are not permanent. Many of them are on posters which are changed frequently, or sticker grafitti which is removed by the council or the weather.
			<br> <br>I am proposing a website with a digital map of the city (like google maps) which you can explore and find QR codes that are/were once in the city. They will be on the map where they were found in the city. </p>
		<h2> Target audience </h2>
		<p>The target audience of this website are most likely people living in Wellington city, as they will be the most interestd in what websites the codes lead to.
			<br><br>More specifically, it will be those who wander around the city and actually encounter these codes on a day to day baisis (students, people who walk to work), and people who browse
 the internet	a lot who will be the most interested in this site.
			<br><br>Tourists and pepole from around New Zealand may also be interested in exploring the QR codes of Wellington. </p>
			<h2>Inspiration</h2>
			<p> Inspiration for this project includes other digital QR code archives, like <a href="https://wtfqrcodes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> WTF QR Codes </a> on Tumblr.
				<br><br>This blog was dedicated to 'stupid' QR codes but still served to keep a log of QR codes that people can scan and go to the cooresponding web page.
				<br><br>This was also a good example of what I want to achieve in the way that it is community based. People could send in photos from wherever they were in the world to be shared on this site.	</p>

				<p>Another inspiration for my project is the database for the locations of <a href=https://deaddrops.com/db-map-2/>Dead Drops</a> around the globe. This site features a submission function, as well as a map that
					users can find their way around.
					<br><br>Because Dead Drops is an offline project, you cannot find any data apart from the location of the USB stick, and photos of its placement on the database.
					<br><br>On Q-ARCHIVE, I want there to be a hyperlink to where the original QR code was found, as well as a
					clear photo of the original QR code. This way people using the archive can travel on a digital journey through all of the websites that the QR codes lead to. </p>
