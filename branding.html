		<h2>Logo</h2>
		<img src="img/QARCHIVES_logo.png">
		<p> The name Q-Archive is a play on the term QR code and archive. <thead>

		</thead>The Q-Archive logo takes on a glitch style aesthic. This try of art is influenced by computer programming and and technology and gives the brand a futuristic vibe. Glitches are imperfections with technology, much the same way that many of the QR code stickers around the city are grafitti, which will eventually be removed.

<h2>Colour Pallet</h2>

<img src="img/QARCHIVES-COLOUR.png">
<p> The colour pallet for the website is inspired by glitch/Neo-Tokyo colours. These bright neon colours will be used against a dark, blue tinted background colour scheme.

	<h2> Primary font </h2>
		<img src="img/SCP_font.png">
		<p> Source Code Pro is a Google font which can be found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro"> here.</a> It was origianlly designed to use in code programs, because all of the glyphs have uniform widths. However, on the Q-ARCHIVE website it will help give a digital and futuristic feel to the website. It will be used for all of the headers on the website.

	<h2> Secondary font </h2>
		<img src="img/lato_font.png">
		<p> Lato is a Google font which can be found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?selection.family=Lato#standard-styles"> here.</a> Compared to Source Code Pro, it is lighter and easier to read as a body font on a website, while still keeping the same visual style of the primary font. Both of the fonts I have chosen are sans serif fonts as to increase legibility online.
